## 👋 Hi there!, I’m Fazliddin

I’m a backend developer with a passion for solving real-world business problems through automation. I like to focus on using modern technology stacks that get the job done efficiently, without overcomplicating things. I’m not a fan of trying to optimize for efficiency before it’s needed, but I always make sure to follow best practices and use proven design patterns that are easy to find and implement. I believe in building clean, maintainable systems that can scale with the business, but I keep things practical and straightforward.
